                    <p>The most boring thing I did this summer was trying to get discord.py 0.16.7 to work, but I've also done something fun, and that was going to Stockholm.</p>
                    <p>I have not swam anything this summer. My body has been dry, and that felt good. I do not like to submerge my body in water, you see.</p>

                    <p>The best thing I ate this summer was tortellini gratain and I would like to compare the taste of it with heaven. It was so good. Here is the <a href="https://zeinaskitchen.se/tortellinigratang/">recipe</a> if you want to make it yourself.</p>
                    <p>I have not watched any TV-series this summer, because I do not like watching TV-series. The closest I've come to actually watching anything was when I watched one episode of The Walking Dead, but I personally wouldn't count that.</p>

                    <p>A person I met this summer was my friend Lukas, and I would like to cite him by saying: "Trump is an idiot".</p>
                    <p>One day this summer I visited MÃ¥rseleforsarna. It was very pretty there, and you can see how it looked like there in the above image.</p>

                <p>I would like to summarize my summer with these three words: hot, sweaty and nice.</p>
                <p>A pretty okay symmer, but I have really looked forward to starting school again and I think this year at NTI will be interesting and I think I will learn a lot.</p>
